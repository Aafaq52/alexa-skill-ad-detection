Welcome to Communities We Love On, Our mission is to provide women and children survivors of sex trafficking, teen dating violence, stalking, and all domestic violence survivors and their families with a safe, secure way to access National Resources for transitional housing, financial support, effectuating justice, and provide essential services at local levels. This skill was developed in mind as a way for survivors to share their own domestic violence and abuse stories. In the hope that it may let others in the same situations know, that there is a way out and there is always hope and resources available to them. it is time to shift focus from the abusers to the survivors and those still trapped in abusive situations. by sharing our personal stories, we allow ourselves a chance to heal through sharing, while at the same time helping others who might be going through similar things. Stories make us feel less alone, they offer hope and can bring us together. When you share your story with us, you own it. We don't change it. We post it anonymously - because we know that domestic violence can affect anyone and everyone. Often times the public hears only the domestic violence stories that end in tragedy, and while these stories are important to raise awareness, they do tend to leave a void. It is very important for women, men or other persons who are trying to escape this type of situation to know that there are positive outcomes as well, though the journey can be anything but. Help others that may be stuck in a pattern or cycle of violence. If you have escaped domestic violence yourself, please share your story with our listeners, in the hope of encouraging a fellow victim who needs your help. Your voice and story may be the only they ever hear to help them out of their situation. No one should have to live in fear. visit our website, communities we love on, dot org, to see our mission statement, and other initiatives we have to help survivors, or simply to contribute to our cause.

"Here is the description of the program entitled :AudioScholar Demo



Hello and welcome to this short demonstration of the AudioScholar skill 

A clone of this skill can be built specifically for your organization and its training or education needs 

An AudioScholar skill is interactive and you can ask your users questions, record their answers , and get reports 

Think of AudioScholar as a private channel for offering podcast style material,but unlike podcasts, you get feedback from your audience 

The skill is built by the team at AudioEducate and hosted on AudioEducate servers 

Costs are kept low and you can bundle multiple programs to keep it to your budget 

Your audience can access the cloned AudioScholar skill using your own ""skill name"" instantly on any Alexa device 


It works like this : A participant accesses your skill and can listen to the latest programs by saying ""Begin"", or they can ask for a specific program by catalog number, or listen to programs based on a specific topic 

When done, you can ask your users a series of questions to get feedback 

The results are collected and you can use the information to build better programs or improve your products 


To obtain more information go to the AudioEducate website at AudioEducate dot com ,or send an email to: service at audioeducate dot com 

Next we will have a short 10 second audio segment and then ask some questions 

When done you can go on to examples of actual programs done for other AudioScholar clients 




The program will now begin",B083FRPHL1,begin,Yes,Yes,"Positive.

Using the audio podcasting platforms to teach https://anchor.fm/william-d-jackson and using Facebook, Let The Bible Speak TV in collaboration across the Internet. https://www.facebook.com/LET-the-BIBLE-SPEAK-TV-109526513806972 Youth, teens, young adults need to have opportunities to build their technology skills to be the digital leaders their nations will need in the future as technology continues to grow in influence and evolution. Many biblical, bible, ministerial, church schools are not providing the necessary instruction for ministers to adapt. The technology of content creation can cross geographical boundaries and bring those of other faiths together for a common good of worships. Technology will open doors for Christian's, Moslems, and other faiths to work together in blogging, podcasting, and sharing content that is global. Global influences can be created that influence social, economic, geopolitical and educational strategies and initiatives. Using digital tools that have long reaches where faith, friendships and fellowship grow. Where even professional educators, administrators and educational advocates can meet in safe places to share ideas for educational reforms that actually benefit children, families, and communities. Ministries must continue to embrace technology and even require their ministers, evangelist, preachers, teachers and others in leadership to know beyond basic skills so they can build relationships digitally. Christ emphasized relationships, building, maintaining and create that builds a collaboration of praise and worship. The questions of should ministries start using social media has been answered.

There always seems to be an endless list of jobs that need doing: repairs around the home, paperwork, car maintenance, throwing out junk, cleaning the patio, weeding the garden – on and on and on! The more we put them off, the more the list grows and the more they contribute to your stress levels. So make a list of all of these chores and then schedule something I call a “Blitz Day”. On this day, you will rise early and spend the whole day sorting out each of these jobs. Take few breaks and only have a quick bite at lunchtime and just blitz through these irritating but necessary tasks. This will get rid of them, you’ll lower the stress they cause but more importantly, you’ll realize just how effective and industrious you can be when you apply the full force of your will to accomplish things.

Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life. He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from  dying.    
    The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. 

    He became so powerful, the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.  Ironic.  He could save others from death, but not himself.
