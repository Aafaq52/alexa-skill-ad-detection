Welcome to Communities We Love On, Our mission is to provide women and children survivors of sex trafficking, teen dating violence, stalking, and all domestic violence survivors and their families with a safe, secure way to access National Resources for transitional housing, financial support, effectuating justice, and provide essential services at local levels. This skill was developed in mind as a way for survivors to share their own domestic violence and abuse stories. In the hope that it may let others in the same situations know, that there is a way out and there is always hope and resources available to them. it is time to shift focus from the abusers to the survivors and those still trapped in abusive situations. by sharing our personal stories, we allow ourselves a chance to heal through sharing, while at the same time helping others who might be going through similar things. Stories make us feel less alone, they offer hope and can bring us together. When you share your story with us, you own it. We don't change it. We post it anonymously - because we know that domestic violence can affect anyone and everyone. Often times the public hears only the domestic violence stories that end in tragedy, and while these stories are important to raise awareness, they do tend to leave a void. It is very important for women, men or other persons who are trying to escape this type of situation to know that there are positive outcomes as well, though the journey can be anything but. Help others that may be stuck in a pattern or cycle of violence. If you have escaped domestic violence yourself, please share your story with our listeners, in the hope of encouraging a fellow victim who needs your help. Your voice and story may be the only they ever hear to help them out of their situation.

Hello and welcome to this short demonstration of the AudioScholar skill 

A clone of this skill can be built specifically for your organization and its training or education needs

Costs are kept low and you can bundle multiple programs to keep it to your budget 

Your audience can access the cloned AudioScholar skill using your own ""skill name"" instantly on any Alexa device 


It works like this : A participant accesses your skill and can listen to the latest programs by saying ""Begin"", or they can ask for a specific program by catalog number, or listen to programs based on a specific topic 

When done, you can ask your users a series of questions to get feedback 

The results are collected and you can use the information to build better programs or improve your products 


To obtain more information go to the AudioEducate website at AudioEducate dot com ,or send an email to: service at audioeducate dot com 

Next we will have a short 10 second audio segment and then ask some questions 

When done you can go on to examples of actual programs done for other AudioScholar clients

    Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend.
