Welcome to Communities We Love On, Our mission is to provide women and children survivors of sex trafficking, teen dating violence, stalking, and all domestic violence survivors and their families with a safe, secure way to access National Resources for transitional housing, financial support, effectuating justice, and provide essential services at local levels. This skill was developed in mind as a way for survivors to share their own domestic violence and abuse stories. In the hope that it may let others in the same situations know, that there is a way out and there is always hope and resources available to them. it is time to shift focus from the abusers to the survivors and those still trapped in abusive situations. by sharing our personal stories, we allow ourselves a chance to heal through sharing, while at the same time helping others who might be going through similar things. Stories make us feel less alone, they offer hope and can bring us together. When you share your story with us, you own it. We don\\'t change it. We post it anonymously - because we know that domestic violence can affect anyone and everyone. Often times the public hears only the domestic violence stories that end in tragedy, and while these stories are important to raise awareness, they do tend to leave a void. It is very important for women, men or other persons who are trying to escape this type of situation to know that there are positive outcomes as well, though the journey can be anything but. Help others that may be stuck in a pattern or cycle of violence. If you have escaped domestic violence yourself, please share your story with our listeners, in the hope of encouraging a fellow victim who needs your help. Your voice and story may be the only they ever hear to help them out of their situation. No one should have to live in fear. visit our website, communities we love on, dot org, to see our mission statement, and other initiatives we have to help survivors, or simply to contribute to our cause.

Many biblical, bible, ministerial, church schools are not providing the necessary instruction for ministers to adapt. The technology of content creation can cross geographical boundaries and bring those of other faiths together for a common good of worships. Technology will open doors for Christian's, Moslems, and other faiths to work together in blogging, podcasting, and sharing content that is global. Global influences can be created that influence social, economic, geopolitical and educational strategies and initiatives. Using digital tools that have long reaches where faith, friendships and fellowship grow. Where even professional educators, administrators and educational advocates can meet in safe places to share ideas for educational reforms that actually benefit children, families, and communities. Ministries must continue to embrace technology and even require their ministers, evangelist, preachers, teachers and others in leadership to know beyond basic skills so they can build relationships digitally. Christ emphasized relationships, building, maintaining and create that builds a collaboration of praise and worship. The questions of should ministries start using social media has been answered.

    "\n",
    "1. If the text talks about a company or product or a service and describe its fucntionality or qualities then it is an advertisement. For example, \"Try AF Devs, which is right in poonta caughna village. a full service multimedia group, that distributes high end audio and video brands to tailor your home with. Making homes smarter and more enjoyable since 2008. ,their phone number is,829-899-2757,I have sent these details to the Alexa App on your phone. Time to get some gadgets\" contains an advertisment.\n",
    "2. It contains the wording such as \"opening <skill name> by a <developer name>\" or \"handing off to <skill name> by <develper name>\" or \"<skill name> from <developer name>\". A text which tells an app is being made \"by\" or \"provided by\" an entity when entity name is provided. For example \"Handing off to Unofficial WhatsApp Jokes by Wisdom Is Principal Apps . Hello there . Welcome to unofficial whatsapp jokesWhat is you first name please?\" contains an advertisement.\n",
    "3. If a text asks for an action such as to visit a website or downlaod an app, or call a number. For examle, \"Evergreen Wealth Advisory voice application does not know the answer to that question. Please visit https://evergreenwealthadvisory.com/ or give us a call at (587) 480-7476 and we will gladly answer your question. What else can I help with?\" contains an advertisement.\n",
    "4. If a text has a welcome message from a company or app and also describe its services or products and advertises itself. For example, \"Welcome to Prisom Technology LLP. A UX & UI design, Game App & Amazon Alexa Skills Development Global IT Company. What do you want to know about Prisom? Select option from. First, Service. Second, About Us. Third, Contact Us.\" contains an advertisement.\n",
    "5. If a text appears to promote or advertise a product, service, company, a place or a brand then it contains an advertisemnt.\n",
    "6. Any text not containing an advertisement is a \"no-ad\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is an advertisement say \"Positive\". Then provide a one line brief explanation of why the text contains an advertisemnt.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if there is no advertisement then say \"Negative\". Then provide a one line brief explanation of why the text does not contains an advertisemnt.\n",
    "Providing a one line brief explanation is necessary.\n",

This skill was developed in mind as a way for survivors to share their own domestic violence and abuse stories. In the hope that it may let others in the same situations know, that there is a way out and there is always hope and resources available to them. it is time to shift focus from the abusers to the survivors and those still trapped in abusive situations. by sharing our personal stories, we allow ourselves a chance to heal through sharing, while at the same time helping others who might be going through similar things. Stories make us feel less alone, they offer hope and can bring us together. When you share your story with us, you own it. We don't change it. We post it anonymously - because we know that domestic violence can affect anyone and everyone. Often times the public hears only the domestic violence stories that end in tragedy, and while these stories are important to raise awareness, they do tend to leave a void. It is very important for women, men or other persons who are trying to escape this type of situation to know that there are positive outcomes as well, though the journey can be anything but. Help others that may be stuck in a pattern or cycle of violence. If you have escaped domestic violence yourself, please share your story with our listeners, in the hope of encouraging a fellow victim who needs your help.

Welcome to Communities We Love On, Our mission is to provide women and children survivors of sex trafficking, teen dating violence, stalking, and all domestic violence survivors and their families with a safe, secure way to access National Resources for transitional housing, financial support, effectuating justice, and provide essential services at local levels. This skill was developed in mind as a way for survivors to share their own domestic violence and abuse stories. In the hope that it may let others in the same situations know, that there is a way out and there is always hope and resources available to them. it is time to shift focus from the abusers to the survivors and those still trapped in abusive situations. by sharing our personal stories, we allow ourselves a chance to heal through sharing, while at the same time helping others who might be going through similar things. Stories make us feel less alone, they offer hope and can bring us together. When you share your story with us, you own it. We don't change it. We post it anonymously - because we know that domestic violence can affect anyone and everyone. Often times the public hears only the domestic violence stories that end in tragedy, and while these stories are important to raise awareness, they do tend to leave a void. It is very important for women, men or other persons who are trying to escape this type of situation to know that there are positive outcomes as well, though the journey can be anything but. Help others that may be stuck in a pattern or cycle of violence. If you have escaped domestic violence yourself, please share your story with our listeners, in the hope of encouraging a fellow victim who needs your help. Your voice and story may be the only they ever hear to help them out of their situation.
