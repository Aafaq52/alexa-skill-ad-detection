Welcome to Communities We Love On, Our mission is to provide women and children survivors of sex trafficking, teen dating violence, stalking, and all domestic violence survivors and their families with a safe, secure way to access National Resources for transitional housing, financial support, effectuating justice, and provide essential services at local levels. This skill was developed in mind as a way for survivors to share their own domestic violence and abuse stories. In the hope that it may let others in the same situations know, that there is a way out and there is always hope and resources available to them. it is time to shift focus from the abusers to the survivors and those still trapped in abusive situations. by sharing our personal stories, we allow ourselves a chance to heal through sharing, while at the same time helping others who might be going through similar things. Stories make us feel less alone, they offer hope and can bring us together. When you share your story with us, you own it. We don't change it. We post it anonymously - because we know that domestic violence can affect anyone and everyone. Often times the public hears only the domestic violence stories that end in tragedy, and while these stories are important to raise awareness, they do tend to leave a void. It is very important for women, men or other persons who are trying to escape this type of situation to know that there are positive outcomes as well, though the journey can be anything but. Help others that may be stuck in a pattern or cycle of violence. If you have escaped domestic violence yourself, please share your story with our listeners, in the hope of encouraging a fellow victim who needs your help. Your voice and story may be the only they ever hear to help them out of their situation.

When done, you can ask your users a series of questions to get feedback 

The results are collected and you can use the information to build better programs or improve your products 


To obtain more information go to the AudioEducate website at AudioEducate dot com ,or send an email to: service at audioeducate dot com

Many biblical, bible, ministerial, church schools are not providing the necessary instruction for ministers to adapt. The technology of content creation can cross geographical boundaries and bring those of other faiths together for a common good of worships. Technology will open doors for Christian's, Moslems, and other faiths to work together in blogging, podcasting, and sharing content that is global. Global influences can be created that influence social, economic, geopolitical and educational strategies and initiatives. Using digital tools that have long reaches where faith, friendships and fellowship grow. Where even professional educators, administrators and educational advocates can meet in safe places to share ideas for educational reforms that actually benefit children, families, and communities.
